CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY InvitedUserBehavior (VERTEX<User> inputUser) FOR GRAPH AntiFraud {
/*
 This query is motivated to detect those fradulent users who conduct activities to earn
 referral bonus. How do we do that?

 Given an input user, this query traverses the graph, finds out how many two-hop users that
 are indirectely invited by the input user. That is, the users invited by the input user's
 invitees. It also calculates the transferred total money from the one-hop invitees.
 Finally, the traversed subgraph is returned. Intuitively, if it's a fradulent user, we
 can tell from the money transferred from their direct invitees; and their indirect invitees
 should be small or zero.

Sample input
  inputUser: any integer between 1 and 80,000,000
