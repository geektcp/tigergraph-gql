CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY MultiTransaction (VERTEx<Transaction> transaction) FOR GRAPH AntiFraud{
/*
 This query is motivated by detecting money laundering activities between two groups. Given
 a transaction, it finds the network of users related to the sender, and finds the network
 of users related to the receiver. Then, it finds all transactions among the two networks.

 Intuitively this query can help data analysts to visualize the money laundering activities,
 since it can visualize the transactions between the sender and receiver groups, and the
 transaction patterns within each network.

  1) Start from an input transaction, find its sender and reciever
  2) Start from the sender, via Device_Token and Payment_Instrument edges find users within 4 steps.
  3) Start from the reciever, via Device_Token and Payment_Instrument edges find users within 4 steps.
  4) Record transactions cross the sender and receiver groups.

  Sample input
  transaction: any integer between 1 and 800,000,000
